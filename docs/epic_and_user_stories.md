# OIDC Server Implementation: Epic and User Stories
## Epic: Develop Privacy-Focused OIDC Server
### User Story 1: OIDC Protocol Implementation
As a developer, I need to implement the core OIDC protocol so that the server can handle standard OIDC authentication flows.
Tasks:
- Implement authorization endpoint
- Implement token endpoint
- Implement userinfo endpoint
- Support for standard OIDC scopes (openid, profile, email, etc.)
- Implement OIDC discovery endpoint (.well-known/openid-configuration)
### User Story 2: Pseudonym Generation
As a developer, I need to create a system for generating and managing pseudonyms so that each user-vendor pair has a unique, consistent identity.
Tasks:
- Develop algorithm for generating unique pseudonyms
- Create database schema for storing user-vendor-pseudonym mappings
- Implement mechanism to consistently return the same pseudonym for a given user-vendor pair
### User Story 3: Fake Profile Generation
As a developer, I need to implement a system for generating believable fake profile data to provide to vendors instead of real user data.
Tasks:
- Develop algorithms for generating fake names, addresses, and other profile data
- Ensure generated data is consistent for each pseudonym
- Implement mechanism to store and retrieve generated fake data
### User Story 4: Encryption Implementation
As a developer, I need to implement robust encryption for storing real user data to ensure its security.
Tasks:
- Research and select appropriate encryption algorithms
- Implement encryption for all stored real user data
- Develop key management system
- Ensure encrypted data can be securely decrypted when necessary
### User Story 5: Authentication Flow
As a developer, I need to implement the authentication flow that allows users to log in with real credentials but presents pseudonyms to vendors.
Tasks:
- Implement user registration and login system
- Develop flow for authenticating real user and selecting/generating appropriate pseudonym
- Ensure OIDC responses contain pseudonym data instead of real user data
### User Story 6: Vendor Integration API
As a developer, I need to create an API for vendor integration so that vendors can easily configure and use our OIDC server.
Tasks:
- Develop API endpoints for vendor registration
- Implement client credentials management
- Create documentation for vendor integration
### User Story 7: Compliance Management
As a developer, I need to implement a system for managing different compliance requirements so that we can handle varying regulations for different vendors.
Tasks:
- Create a configurable compliance rule engine
- Implement storage for vendor-specific compliance requirements
- Develop mechanism to apply appropriate compliance rules during authentication flows
### User Story 8: Logging and Monitoring
As a developer, I need to implement comprehensive logging and monitoring so that we can track usage, detect issues, and ensure security.
Tasks:
- Implement detailed logging throughout the OIDC server
- Develop monitoring system for tracking server health and performance
- Create alerts for suspicious activities or potential security issues
### User Story 9: Testing and Security Audit
As a developer, I need to create a comprehensive test suite and conduct a security audit to ensure the OIDC server is robust and secure.
Tasks:
- Develop unit tests for all core functionalities
- Implement integration tests for full authentication flows
- Conduct (or prepare for) a thorough security audit
- Perform penetration testing
