# OIDC Protocol Implementation Status and Plan

## Already Implemented:
1. django-oidc-provider is installed and configured in `settings.py`
2. OIDC URLs are included in `sso_server/urls.py`
3. Custom userinfo function is defined in `sso_app/views.py`
4. Custom scope claims are defined in `sso_app/utils.py`
5. Basic authentication views (login, register, logout) are implemented

## To Be Implemented or Modified:
1. Authorization Endpoint:
   - Review and possibly customize the authorization flow in `sso_app/views.py`

2. Token Endpoint:
   - Verify that the token endpoint is properly configured and functioning

3. Userinfo Endpoint:
   - The `userinfo` function in `sso_app/views.py` needs to be reviewed and possibly modified to ensure it's returning the correct claims based on the scopes

4. OIDC Scopes:
   - Review and possibly expand the custom scopes in `sso_app/utils.py`
   - Ensure that the `CustomScopeClaims` class is properly handling all required scopes

5. OIDC Discovery Endpoint:
   - Verify that the .well-known/openid-configuration endpoint is properly set up
   - If not, implement it in `sso_app/views.py` and add the URL pattern in `sso_server/urls.py`

6. Testing:
   - Implement comprehensive tests for the OIDC flow in `sso_app/tests.py`

7. Documentation:
   - Update the README.md with detailed instructions on how to use the OIDC server

8. Security Review:
   - Conduct a thorough security review of the implemented OIDC flow
   - Ensure all sensitive data is properly protected

9. Error Handling:
   - Implement robust error handling for all OIDC-related operations

10. Logging:
    - Implement detailed logging for OIDC operations for debugging and auditing purposes

Next Steps:
1. Review the existing implementation in detail
2. Implement the missing components
3. Conduct thorough testing of the entire OIDC flow
4. Update documentation
5. Perform a security audit
